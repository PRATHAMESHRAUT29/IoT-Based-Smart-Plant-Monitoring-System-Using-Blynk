# IoT-Based-Smart-Plant-Monitoring-System-Using-Blynk
An IoT-based smart plant monitoring system using NodeMCU ESP8266, Blynk, and various sensors for automated plant care Components: NodeMCU ESP8266: The brain of the system, which reads data from the sensors, controls the water pump via the relay, and connects to the Blynk app for remote monitoring. Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture level of the soil. The data is sent to the NodeMCU, which determines whether the soil is too dry. PIR Motion Sensor: Detects any movement around the plants, which could trigger notifications or other actions like turning on lights. Relay Module: Acts as an electrical switch controlled by the NodeMCU to turn the water pump on or off based on the soil moisture levels. Water Pump: Provides water to the plants when the soil moisture sensor indicates that the soil is dry. Breadboard and Jumpers: Used to connect the various components without soldering, making the circuit easy to assemble and modify. 18650 Battery: Powers the entire system, making it portable and usable in areas without a direct power supply. Tactile Push Button: Provides manual control, allowing the user to trigger the water pump or reset the system. Blynk App: A mobile application that allows real-time monitoring and control of the plant monitoring system. It provides a user-friendly interface to see sensor data and manually activate the water pump if needed. System Functionality: Soil Moisture Detection and Watering:  The soil moisture sensor continuously monitors the moisture level in the soil. If the soil is detected as dry (below a certain threshold), the NodeMCU will trigger the relay to turn on the water pump. The pump waters the plants until the soil moisture reaches the desired level, then it automatically turns off. Motion Detection:  The PIR sensor detects motion around the plants. If motion is detected, it can trigger an alert via the Blynk app or other actions, such as turning on lights. Blynk Integration:  The NodeMCU connects to the Blynk cloud server, sending real-time data from the sensors to the Blynk app. Users can monitor the moisture level and motion detection status through the app. The Blynk app allows users to manually control the water pump, enabling watering remotely.
